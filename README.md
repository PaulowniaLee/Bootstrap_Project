# Bootstrap_Project
This project was for the course STAT3602 at HKU. I estimated a statistic in the given question and treated its error with bootstrap. The statistic is quite novel, and I provied derivation of its closed form in the report. I used random seeds wherever randomness was introduced, so all codes are reproducible.
